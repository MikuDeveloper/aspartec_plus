# Aspartec+

A simple Flutter application designed to facilitate academic advice sharing among students at ITSCH.

## Description

Sometimes we don't understand certain subjects at school and we don't have anyone to explain the important topics needed to pass the grade. However, we all know schoolmates who are masters in specific subjects or topics. So, why not contact them and ask for advice?

Therefore, this app is designed to improve academic advice sharing at ITSCH.
